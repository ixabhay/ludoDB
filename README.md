Ludo Users CRUD APIs using NodeJS and MongoDB
This is a follow up of a small tutorial I wrote on CRUD Operations using NodeJS and MongoDB 
https://shiftescape.com/2020/01/how-to-make-nodejs-mongodb-rest-apis-for-crud-operations/

This has a lot new content/code added to it. 
Following the tutorial first then using this project would be much easier to follow.
Feel free leave a comment on my blog if you need any help.
I'm also learning things at the moment but like to explore.
